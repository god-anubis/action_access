## Please read before contributing

1. If you have questions about Action Access, use the
   [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/action_access),
   [Gitter's chat](https://gitter.im/matiasgagliano/action_access) or
   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/action_access).
   **DO NOT** post questions here.

2. If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here.
   Please send an e-mail to [mgag.issues@gmail.com](mailto:mgag.issues@gmail.com)
   instead.

3. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to
   see if it was already reported or fixed. In case it wasn't, create your
   report with a **clear description** of the issue and a **code sample** that
   demonstrates it. Include Rails and Action Access versions, and as much
   relevant information as possible. Tests or a sample application showing how
   the expected behavior is not occurring will be much appreciated.

   The more information you give, the easier it becomes to track the issue and
   fix it. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself and others to
   replicate the bug and figure out a fix.

4. **ALWAYS** open an issue (issue tracker) before submitting a pull request to
   discuss the changes and the best ways to implement them, it won't be accepted
   otherwise. Describe your proposal, why is it relevant? For which cases are
   those changes or new features needed?

Thanks for your time and support!
